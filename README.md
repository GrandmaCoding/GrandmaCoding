- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julian Metzger.
- Iâ€™m a student of the .NET and Angular frameworks.
- Iâ€™m currently studying web development with Revature!

After graduating from the University of New Orleans with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I struggled to find a career that matched my interests and skillset. I had a strong interest in programming during my time in college between my intro level computer sciences courses and programming-based engineering classes. I exceled in classes utilizing C, C++, Matlab, Python, and x86 MASM. This gave me wonderful views of how programming works at different levels of abstraction. However, while most of the programs I implemented utilized object oriented data structures and their methods, the vast majority of the programs I wrote were mainly procedural. 



Some examples:

Console-based CRUD and sorting application for a simple plaintext database file in x86 MASM.
Generate basic waveforms on a trainer boards digital to analog converter given a user inputted frequency via button ports.
Measure the frequency or voltage peak of a waveform captured by a analog to digital converter.
  Inputs and outputs on the trainer board return to the user via the 7-segment and/or lcd display.

Declare the activation function(s), loss function, forward propogation, and backward propogation methods for dense neural networks.
Implement those same methods to train, test, and measure the accuracy of simple dense neural networks.

Training and testing historical convolutional neural network architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, and YOLO with the Keras and Tensorflow Python APIs.
Training a recursive neural network on the past stock prices of American Micro Devices via Tensorflow.



My time at Revature has opened me up to the world of object oriented programming and its applications in web development architectures such as .NET's Model-View-Controller and Angular's Component-Router-Service. Frameworks like .NET and Angular are incredibly powerful tools for furthering the ways that people can interact online as well as the information and resources at their fingertips. The field of web development is evolving and growing at an enthralling pace. It's my dream to be a part of it!
